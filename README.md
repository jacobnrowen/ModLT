# Mod(-el theoretic) Logical Transductions 
## For Phonology and Linguistics

Note: This README is still under construction

ModLT implements model-theoretic logical transductions for use by linguists, especially phonologists. It is based on theoretical work like that of *Using Model Theory in Phonology: a Novel Characterization of Syllable Structure and Syllabification* (Kristina Strother-Garcia, 2019).

To install, acquire GHC Haskell, then in a terminal opened to this repository, run `cabal build`, then run `cabal install`. There are example files in the examples folder.


ModLT was developed by Jacob Rowen under the guidance of Jeffrey Heinz and with support from Hypatia du Bois-Marie.
